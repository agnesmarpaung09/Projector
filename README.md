Face Recognition-Based Attendance System using the Random Forest Method

The attendance system is very important as data collection in an agency. And usually, to do absenteeism is done manually using paper. This is certainly less effective in terms of security. If using paper ; 
- will be vulnerable to signature fraud
- Absenteeism can be entrusted to others
- absenteeism can be faked
- takes a long time in the data collection
- requires quite a lot of paper

The solution that can be given to the problem can be applied absenteeism by using facial recognition technology. By using facial recognition, it can be considered effective because facial recognition takes facial samples continuously so that it is fast in reading the characteristics of a person's face. The method used in this attendance is to use a Random Forest. This method is a combined tree method derived from the classification and regression tree (CART) method and is based on decision tree techniques, so as to overcome non-linear problems.
